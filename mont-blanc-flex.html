          The everlasting universe of things<br />
          Flows through the mind, and rolls its rapid waves,<br />
          Now dark—now glittering—now reflecting gloom—<br />
          Now lending splendour, where from secret springs<br />
          The source of human thought its tribute brings<br />
          Of waters—with a sound but half its own,<br />
          Such as a feeble brook will oft assume,<br />
          In the wild woods, among the mountains lone,<br />
          Where waterfalls around it leap for ever,<br />
          Where woods and winds contend, and a vast river<br />
          Over its rocks ceaselessly bursts and raves.

          Thus thou, Ravine of Arve—dark, deep Ravine—<br />
          Thou many-colour'd, many-voiced vale,<br />
          Over whose pines, and crags, and caverns sail<br />
          Fast cloud-shadows and sunbeams: awful scene,<br />
          Where Power in likeness of the Arve comes down<br />
          From the ice-gulfs that gird his secret throne,<br />
          Bursting through these dark mountains like the flame<br />
          Of lightning through the tempest;—thou dost lie,<br />
          Thy giant brood of pines around thee clinging,<br />
          Children of elder time, in whose devotion<br />
          The chainless winds still come and ever came<br />
          To drink their odours, and their mighty swinging<br />
          To hear—an old and solemn harmony;<br />
          Thine earthly rainbows stretch'd across the sweep<br />
          Of the aethereal waterfall, whose veil<br />
          Robes some unsculptur'd image; the strange sleep<br />
          Which when the voices of the desert fail<br />
          Wraps all in its own deep eternity;<br />
          Thy caverns echoing to the Arve's commotion,<br />
          A loud, lone sound no other sound can tame;<br />
          Thou art pervaded with that ceaseless motion,<br />
          Thou art the path of that unresting sound—<br />
          Dizzy Ravine! and when I gaze on thee<br />
          I seem as in a trance sublime and strange<br />
          To muse on my own separate fantasy,<br />
          My own, my human mind, which passively<br />
          Now renders and receives fast influencings,<br />
          Holding an unremitting interchange<br />
          With the clear universe of things around;<br />
          One legion of wild thoughts, whose wandering wings<br />
          Now float above thy darkness, and now rest<br />
          Where that or thou art no unbidden guest,<br />
          In the still cave of the witch Poesy,<br />
          Seeking among the shadows that pass by<br />
          Ghosts of all things that are, some shade of thee,<br />
          Some phantom, some faint image; till the breast<br />
          From which they fled recalls them, thou art there!<br />

        <p>Some say that gleams of a remoter world</p>
        <p>Visit the soul in sleep, that death is slumber,</p>
        <p>And that its shapes the busy thoughts outnumber</p>
        <p>Of those who wake and live.—I look on high;</p>
        <p>Has some unknown omnipotence unfurl'd</p>
        <p>The veil of life and death? or do I lie</p>
        <p>In dream, and does the mightier world of sleep</p>
        <p>Spread far around and inaccessibly</p>
        <p>Its circles? For the very spirit fails,</p>
        <p>Driven like a homeless cloud from steep to steep</p>
        <p>That vanishes among the viewless gales!</p>
        <p>Far, far above, piercing the infinite sky,</p>
        <p>Mont Blanc appears—still, snowy, and serene;</p>
        <p>Its subject mountains their unearthly forms</p>
        <p>Pile around it, ice and rock; broad vales between</p>
        <p>Of frozen floods, unfathomable deeps,</p>
        <p>Blue as the overhanging heaven, that spread</p>
        <p>And wind among the accumulated steeps;</p>
        <p>A desert peopled by the storms alone,</p>
        <p>Save when the eagle brings some hunter's bone,</p>
        <p>And the wolf tracks her there—how hideously</p>
        <p>Its shapes are heap'd around! rude, bare, and high,</p>
        <p>Ghastly, and scarr'd, and riven.—Is this the scene</p>
        <p>Where the old Earthquake-daemon taught her young</p>
        <p>Ruin? Were these their toys? or did a sea</p>
        <p>Of fire envelop once this silent snow?</p>
        <p>None can reply—all seems eternal now.</p>
        <p>The wilderness has a mysterious tongue</p>
        <p>Which teaches awful doubt, or faith so mild,</p>
        <p>So solemn, so serene, that man may be,</p>
        <p>But for such faith, with Nature reconcil'd;</p>
        <p>Thou hast a voice, great Mountain, to repeal</p>
        <p>Large codes of fraud and woe; not understood</p>
        <p>By all, but which the wise, and great, and good</p>
        <p>Interpret, or make felt, or deeply feel.</p>

          Mont Blanc yet gleams on high:—the power is there,<br />
          The still and solemn power of many sights,<br />
          And many sounds, and much of life and death.<br />
          In the calm darkness of the moonless nights,<br />
          In the lone glare of day, the snows descend<br />
          Upon that Mountain; none beholds them there,<br />
          Nor when the flakes burn in the sinking sun,<br />
          Or the star-beams dart through them. Winds contend<br />
          Silently there, and heap the snow with breath<br />
          Rapid and strong, but silently! Its home<br />
          The voiceless lightning in these solitudes<br />
          Keeps innocently, and like vapour broods<br />
          Over the snow. The secret Strength of things<br />
          Which governs thought, and to the infinite dome<br />
          Of Heaven is as a law, inhabits thee!<br />
          And what were thou, and earth, and stars, and sea,<br />
          If to the human mind's imaginings<br />
          Silence and solitude were vacancy?<br />
